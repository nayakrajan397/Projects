# Welcome to My Journey into Python Development!
Hi Everyone! 👋

I am a Data Analyst with 4 years of experience in Python. While I’ve greatly enjoyed working in data analysis, I’ve recently decided to pivot toward what excites me the most: building business solutions and creating useful scripts. My goal is to transition into a Python Developer role and explore the endless possibilities of application development.

## About This Repository
This is my learning space, where I showcase my journey as I dive deeper into Python application development.

## Current Projects
Investment Calculator
My first Flask-based application 🎉.
Calculates total investment, gains, and final amounts based on user inputs.
I’m actively enhancing it by adding:
Dynamic charts 📈 to visualize results. 
Lumpsum calculation features and more.

## What’s Next?
I aim to:
Build more applications using Flask and other Python frameworks.
Leverage my background in Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create advanced, practical solutions.
